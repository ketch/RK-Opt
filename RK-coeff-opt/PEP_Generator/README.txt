1. The list of PEP conditions is obtained from 'Energy-preserving_conjugates.ipynb'

2. This conditions must be applied to the file 'PEPGenerator.jl', which generates PEP conditions,
one by one, in Butcher Notation.

3. Finally, copy-paste the output in 'Translator.ipynb', which returns the PEP condition in Matlab format.

This code was written for Julia v1.6. The versions of the Julia packages are recorded in the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files.
