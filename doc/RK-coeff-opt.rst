RK-coeff-opt
============
This subpackage contains routines for finding optimal Runge-Kutta method coefficents,
given a prescribed order of accuracy, number of stages, and an objective function.  
Constraints on the stability polynomial (possibly obtained using **polyopt** or **am_radius-opt**)
can optionally be provided.

check_RK_order
===================================
::

    function p = check_RK_order(A,b,c)

Determines order of a RK method, up to sixth order.

For an s-stage method, input `A` should be a `s \times s` matrix;
`b` and `c` should be column vectors of length `s`.



errcoeff
===============================
::

    function D = errcoeff(A,b,c,p)


**Inputs**:
   - `A`, `b`, `c` -- Butcher tableau
   - `p`         -- order of accuracy of the method

Computes the norm of the vector of truncation error coefficients
for the terms of order `p+1`: 
(elementary weight - 1/(density of the tree)/(symmetry of the tree)


For now we just use Butcher's approach.  We could alternatively use Albrecht's.






linear_constraints
===================================================================
::

    function [Aeq,beq,lb,ub] = linear_constraints(s,class,objective,k)


This sets up:

      * The linear constraints, corresponding to the consistency conditions
        `\sum_j b_j = 1` and `\sum_j a_{ij} = c_j`.
      * The upper and lower bounds on the unknowns.  These are chosen
        somewhat arbitrarily, but usually aren't important as long as
        they're not too restrictive.



nonlinear_constraints
==================================================================================================
::

    function [con,coneq]=nonlinear_constraints(x,class,s,p,objective,poly_coeff_ind,poly_coeff_val,k)

Impose nonlinear constraints:
  - if objective = 'ssp' : both order conditions and absolute monotonicity conditions
  - if objective = 'acc' : order conditions
The input arguments are:
    * :math:`x`: vector of the decision variables.  See unpack_rk.m for details about
      the order in which they are stored.
    * *class*: class of method to search ('erk' = explicit RK; 'irk' = implicit RK; 'dirk' = diagonally implicit RK; 'sdirk' = singly diagonally implicit RK; '2S', '3S', '2S*', '3S*' = low-storage formulations).
    * :math:`s`:number of stages.
    * :math:`p`: order of the RK scheme.
    * *objective*: objective function ('ssp' = maximize SSP coefficient; 'acc' = minimize leading truncation error coefficient).
    * *poly_coeff_ind*: index of the polynomial coefficients (:math:`\beta_j`) for :math:`j > p`.
    * *poly_coeff_val*: values of the polynomial coefficients (:math:`\beta_j`) for :math:`j > p` (tall-tree elementary weights).

The outputs are:
    * *con*: inequality constraints, i.e. absolute monotonicity conditions if objective = 'ssp' or nothing if objective = 'acc'
    * *coneq*: order conditions plus stability function coefficients constraints (tall-tree elementary weights)

Two forms of the order conditions are implemented: one based on **Butcher's
approach**, and one based on **Albrecht's approach**. One or the other may lead 
to a more tractable optimization problem in some cases, but this has not been 
explored carefully. The Albrecht order conditions are implemented up to order 9, assuming
a certain stage order, while the Butcher order conditions are implemented up to order 9 but
do not assume anything about the stage order. Albrecht's approach is used
by default.



oc_albrecht
====================================
::

    function coneq=oc_albrecht(A,b,c,p)

This version is based on Butcher's approach.

Assumes `p>1`.



oc_ksrk
=======================================
::

    function coneq= oc_ksrk(A,b,D,theta,p)

Order conditions for multistep-RK methods.



order_conditions
=====================================================
::

    function tau = order_conditions(x,class,s,p,Aeq,beq)


This is just a small wrapper, used when solveorderconditions=1.



rk_obj
=============================================
::

    function [r,g]=rk_obj(x,class,s,p,objective)

Objective function for RK optimization.

The meaning of the input arguments is as follow:
    * :math:`x`: vector of the unknowns.
    * class: class of method to search ('erk' = explicit RK; 'irk' = implicit RK; 'dirk' = diagonally implicit RK; 'sdirk' = singly diagonally implicit RK; '2S', '3S', '2S*', '3S*' = low-storage formulations).
    * :math:`s`:number of stages.
    * :math:`p`: order of the RK scheme.
    * objective: objective function ('ssp' = maximize SSP coefficient; 'acc' = minimize leading truncation error coefficient).

The meaning of the output arguments is as follow:
    * r: it is a scalar containing the radius of absolute monotonicity if objective = 'ssp' or the value of the leading truncation error coefficient if objective = 'acc'.
    * g: it is a vector and contains the gradient of the objective function respect to the unknowns.  It is an array with all zero elements except for the last component which is equal to one if objective = 'ssp' or it is an empty array if objective = 'acc'. 



rk_opt
===================================================
::

    function rk = rk_opt(s,p,class,objective,varargin)


Find optimal RK and multistep RK methods.
The meaning of the arguments is as follows:

    * :math:`s`: number of stages.
    * :math:`k`: number of steps (1 for RK methods)
    * :math:`p`: order of the Runge-Kutta (RK) scheme.
    * class: class of method to search %       Available classes:

      * 'erk'      : Explicit Runge-Kutta methods
      * 'irk'      : Implicit Runge-Kutta methods
      * 'dirk'     : Diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods
      * 'sdirk'    : Singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods
      * '2S', etc. : Low-storage explicit methods; see *Ketcheson, "Runge-Kutta methods with minimum storage implementations". J. Comput. Phys. 229(5):1763 - 1773, 2010*)
      * 'emsrk1/2'    : Explicit multistep-Runge-Kutta methods
      * 'imsrk1/2'    : Implicit multistep-Runge-Kutta methods
      * 'dimsrk1/2'   : Diagonally implicit multistep-Runge-Kutta methods

    * objective: objective function ('ssp' = maximize SSP coefficient; 'acc' = minimize leading truncation error coefficient)
      Accuracy optimization is not currently supported for multistep RK methods
    * poly_coeff_ind: index of the polynomial coefficients to constrain (:math:`\beta_j`) for :math:`j > p`  (j denotes the index of the stage). The default value is an empty array.  Note that one should not include any indices :math:`i \le p`, since those are determined by the order conditions.
    * poly_coeff_val: constrained values of the polynomial coefficients (:math:`\beta_j`) for :math:`j > p` (tall-tree elementary weights). The default value is an empty array.
    * startvec: vector of the initial guess ('random' = random approach; 'smart' = smart approach; alternatively, the user can provide the startvec array. By default startvec is initialize with random numbers.
    * solveorderconditions: if set to 1, solve the order conditions first before trying to optimize. The default value is 0.
    * np: number of processor to use. If np :math:`> 1` the MATLAB global optimization toolbox *Multistart* is used. The default value is 1 (just one core).
    * max_tries: maximum number of fmincon function calls. The default value is 10.
    * writeToFile: whether to write to a file. If set to 1 write the RK coefficients to a file called "ERK-p-s.txt". The default value is 1.
    * algorithm: which algorithm to use in fmincon: 'sqp','interior-point', or 'active-set'. By default sqp is used.

    .. note::
       **numerical experiments have shown that when the objective function is the minimization of the leading truncation error coefficient, the interior-point algorithm performs much better than the sqp one.**

    * display: level of display of fmincon solver ('off', 'iter', 'notify' or 'final'). The default value is 'notify'.
    * problem_class: class of problems for which the RK is designed ('linear' or 'nonlinear' problems). This option changes the type of order conditions check, i.e. linear or nonlinear order conditions controll. The default value is 'nonlinear'.


.. note::

   Only :math:`s`: , :math:`p`: , class and objective are required inputs.
   All the other arguments are **parameter name - value arguments to the input
   parser scheme**. Therefore they can be specified in any order.

   **Example**::

    >> rk=rk_opt(4,3,'erk','acc','max_tries',2,'np',1,'solveorderconditions',1)

The fmincon options are set through the **optimset** that creates/alters optimization options structure. By default the following additional options are used:
    * MaxFunEvals = 1000000
    * TolCon = 1.e-13
    * TolFun = 1.e-13
    * TolX = 1.e-13
    * MaxIter = 10000
    * Diagnostics = off
    * DerivativeCheck = off
    * GradObj = on, if the objective is set equal to 'ssp'
